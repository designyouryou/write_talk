Now that you have a good idea what you're speaking about and what materials you'll draw from, it's a good idea to form an outline for your talk. My preferred workflow is below, and I have also provided [outline templates](/outline-template/).

## 1. Choose Subtopics

Choose, as a general rule, one subtopic for about every 5 minutes you'll speak for a short talk or every 10 minutes for a long talk. Your subtopics should be relevant to your topic and align with your specific purpose and style. For example, if your purpose is to inform people about ways they can increase their faith, your outline may start as follows:

- Ways to increase faith
  - Increase faith by study and prayer
  - Increase faith through good works
  - Increase faith with a desire to believe

## 2. Add Materials to Subtopics

Since you've already sorted materials into some subtopics, now is a good time to arrange them into your subtopics. Try to create a logical flow between materials, perhaps imagining how you intend to move from one reference to another.

You'll probably want to use about one resource per minute, as a general rule. This can give you enough time to make poignant remarks about a resource, but not so much time you have to make up nonsense to have enough to say.

## 3. Prepare an Introduction

An introduction should put the audience at ease while creating interest. Consider talks you have listened to. In the first few seconds, the audience already makes a decision on whether or not they care about your talk. 

**A good introduction:**

- Shows you're prepared and (at least pretending to be) confident

- Focuses on the message and not its delivery

- Tells the audience immediately what you intend to address

- Establishes credibility and goodwill

**A less effective introduction:**

- Indicates a lack of preparedness to the audience

- Focuses more on the speaker than the message

- Fails to get the audience's attention

- Tells the story of being asked to speak

- Complains or comments about having to speak

### Introduction Styles

Especially for speakers less familiar with presenting material to an audience, the introduction can be the hardest part of a talk to get right. Thankfully, there are a handful of tried-and-true techniques to starting a talk that can get your talk to a great start. It is important to keep an introduction relatively short, as too much introduction will quickly bore an audience. 

Think of an introduction to a talk just like the introduction to a hymn. The audience needs enough of a heads-up to get their attention and know where things are headed. But if an introduction lasts too long, they will start to think they're listening to a musical number, and they can stop paying attention.

**Helpful Tip:** It can be tempting to begin with a joke, but at the start of your talk, the audience is tense and not used to your speaking style. It is best to wait until your subtopics or conclusion to tell a joke. At that point, the audience will be familiar enough with you to enjoy the joke.

Consider using or adapting one of the following styles for your talk:

**Academic Introduction.** This is the most straightforward way to begin. It is precise, no-nonsense, and alerts your audience of your intentions immediately. It goes something like this:

> Good morning, brothers and sisters. I intend today to answer the question "[some version of your purpose statement] using 3 main points. [summary of your subtopics].

At first, it seems dry and clunky. But it indicates to the audience a high level of preparedness and confidence. It puts the audience at ease by subtly indicating there will be no surprises in your talk. And it focuses entirely on the message you intend to share.

**Tell a Story.** People love stories, so it can be interesting to the audience to begin your talk with a story. When you use this introduction style, there's no need for niceties -- just jump right in. This type of introduction might go something like this:

> Brothers and sisters, several years ago while I was speaking in general 
> conference, the sight in my left eye was suddenly compromised by 
> something called macular degeneration, which subsequently worsened and has left me without useful vision in that eye.
> 
> *"Missionary Service Blessed My Life Forever" by M. Russell Ballard.*

This style is effective and popular because it gets people's attention quickly and helps slowly guide their thoughts toward your topic. If used correctly, it arouses curiosity in the audience. And stories are easy to make appealing to a broad audience.

**Relate to the Audience.** This adaptation of an anecdotal introduction sparks the imagination of your audience. Since people pay attention to things which directly affect them, relating a topic to them directly encourages them to pay attention to what you say for the rest of your talk. It might go something like this:

> It's Sunday afternoon, and you're with your siblings in your grandparents' living room. They talk and laugh with you for hours about the crazy things that you all did as kids.

This is an especially powerful introduction style if your purpose is to persuade the audience. The above example is a great way to relay the importance of doing family history work or building good family relationships.

**Arouse Curiosity.** This introduction style goes as long as it can without telling the audience what you'll talk about. Instead, it presents interesting details so the audience mentally has to guess what you're talking about until you finally reveal it. It goes something like this:

> Everyone in this room has a key to happiness. It is this same key to happiness that makes us true disciples of Christ. It invokes a promise from the Lord that He will be with us. Indeed, it allows us to fulfil our divine purpose on this earth. Many overlook this key to happiness, and others still think it is outside their reach. It's not about money, power, or intelligence. I'm talking about dedicating ourselves to loving and serving others.

This approach builds some suspense, and is is a highly effective way to introduce some of your subtopics while you whet the audience's curiosity about your topic.

**Use a Quote.** A relevant quote can be a good way to get the audience's attention and foreshadow a central theme in your talk. An interesting scripture is often a highly effective introduction, as many scriptures can lead to a number of conclusions, leaving your audience curious about the intent of your talk. It can go something like this: 

> When the Lord called six elders, He instructed: "Ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts." When we work to understand the Gospel, we ought to soften our hearts to the counsel of the Lord.

### Preview your Talk

After you get the audience's attention, walk them through your subtopics. You might simply say, "I will address 3 points: a, b, and c". But it can be more interesting and easier to follow if you use a simple sentence, which you can repeat as a transition into each of your subtopics. It works something like this:

> Becoming more self-reliant can help us improve our personal finances, make us better able to serve others, and even improve our mental health. 
> 
> Becoming more self-reliant can help us improve our personal finances. [tell more about this for a couple of minutes]
> 
> Becoming more self-reliant can make us better able to serve others. [tell more about this for a couple of minutes]
> 
> Becoming more self-reliant can even improve our mental health. [tell more about this for a couple of minutes]

## 4. Prepare a Conclusion

When you are ready to end your talk, it's important to wrap up cleanly. In many church meetings, testifying of the truth of your message is an implicit signal to the audience that you're finishing your message. It can often be powerful, though, to testify briefly of the truth of what you're sharing throughout your talk and conclude in another way.

When you conclude, begin by briefly summarizing your subtopics. Then, there are a few options for a potent end to your talk. It is best to keep a conclusion brief.

**Call to Action.** If your goal is to motivate the audience to act, a call to action can be an excellent way to end a talk. Calls to action are often well-accompanied by scripturally-founded promises of blessings. It goes something like this:

> I plead with you to accept the Savior’s invitation. Like a meek and 
> loving child, accept His help. Make and keep the covenants He offers in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They will strengthen 
> you. The Savior knows the storms and the places of safety on the way 
> home to Him and to our Heavenly Father. He knows the way. He is the Way. I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.
> 
> *"Steady in the Storms", By President Henry B. Eyring*

**Use a Quote.** Like in an introduction, a quote can be a pleasing way to end a talk. It can go something like this:

> “It is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine. But it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low.” This is the Church of Jesus Christ. His gospel blesses families here on earth and throughout the eternities. It guides us in our lives as we strive to become eternal families. I know this is true. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
> 
> *"Teaching Self-Reliance to Children and Youth", By Elder Hugo E. Martinez*

**Make a Dramatic Statement.** It can occasionally be helpful to devise your own dramatic statement to end your talk. This is often better-suited for secular talks than religious devotionals, but it can be helpful nonetheless. Consider Patrick Henry's legendary "Liberty or Death" speech:

> I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death.

**Use a Mixed Approach.** It can also be helpful to combine concluding methods, such as in this example:

> So, my dear friends and beloved fellow disciples of Jesus Christ, let us not be “weary in well-doing, for [we] are laying the foundation of a 
> great work.” And out of our small things will proceed “that which is 
> great.” I testify that this is true, as I also testify that Jesus Christ is our 
> Master, our Redeemer, and our one and only Way back to our beloved 
> Father in Heaven. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.
> 
> *"Our Heartfelt All", By Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf*
