At last -- you're about done! At this point, all that's left to do is practice your talk. Practice first by reading every word of your talk out loud. Eventually work on looking more at your audience than at your notes.

## On Eye Contact

If making eye contact with an audience is troubling for you, here are a few tricks I find helpful:

- Tell someone you trust to sit in the middle of the audience, toward the back. Let this person know you'll be trying to make eye contact with them. Then, when you look at your audience, look at this person. The audience won't be any the wiser, since you'll move your eyes past them every time you look up.

- Before you speak, find a point of interest halfway up the back wall and each side wall. It could be an irregularity in the wall covering, a clock, a piece of molding, or even a person. When you look up, visually locate two points of interest. For example, slowly pan your view from the wall clock to the toddler in the back row.

- If eye contact is quite difficult for you, don't sweat it. Chances are, most of the audience will not look at you anyway. It is more valuable to deliver a high-quality address while looking at your notes than it is to deliver a distracted address while trying to look up.

## On Practicing Out Loud

Practicing your talk out loud is crucial. You don't really know what words will trip you up until you've tried to say them. When delivering your talk, remember to speak deliberately and clearly so you can be understood. I find it helpful to imagine I'm delivering my talk to an audience whose first language is not English. That forces me to slow my delivery down and speak clearly.

When practicing your talk, deliberately add moments of silence. These moments will help your mind catch up with your mouth, and they give you a natural way to prevent getting lost in your notes. I add a red star in my notes after impactful points to remember to pause. It will feel strange at first, but it conveys an amount of confidence few novice speakers manage to achieve. Consider the difference: 

> God loves you more than words can express. Um.... The scriptures teach that "For God so loved the world..."
> 
> God loves you more than words can express. [2-second pause] The scriptures teach that "For God so loved the world..."

## On Timing

If you have a specific time limit, practice (and edit) until you can precisely meet that time limit. 

If you have a range of times you may need to fill (i.e. if you are the final speaker), plan a separate talk for each time limit. I highlight the margin of paragraphs to cut, depending on my time restrictions. If my range is 5-20 minutes, for example, I mark paragraphs to cut for a 15-minute talk in red, paragraphs to cut for a 10-minute talk in yellow, and paragraphs to cut for a 5-minute talk in green. I then decide, just before I begin my address, which talk length to deliver.

For either method, practice out loud, including pauses, until you can deliver your talk in the right amount of time. It can be quite valuable to record yourself speaking and review the recording, if you have the time and resources to do so.

## Congratulations!

You've written and practiced a talk. Now go deliver a killer address -- you've got this.
