Drawing from a variety of relevant sources makes for a vastly more interesting talk. When you quote scriptures and respected figures, an audience assigns more value to what you say. Gathering and using high-quality materials is a great way to build credibility with an audience. Even prominent church leaders often cite scriptures, philosophers, literary works, and other church leaders.

This phase is dedicated to gathering and organizing a large bulk of good information, not to deciding where to put it in a talk. Your goal at this point is quantity, not necessarily quality. Try for about 2-3 resources per minute you'll speak. You will likely not use all the materials you find in this phase in your final talk. It can be helpful to think about potential remarks about the material as you select it, though.

I prefer to do this part of talk preparation completely virtually. I create a large document in a word processor, and I simply paste in full citations of all the material I find with a link to where I can find the originals.

## Finding Material

This can be the most time-consuming part of writing a talk, but there are a number of excellent resources to simplify this process. I personally prefer the following workflow to quickly compile a great deal of good information.

### 1. Scriptures

Using the following resources, find scriptures relevant to your topic. Finding a variety of scriptures by a number of different authors helps add variety to your message. When finding scriptures, look both for whole verses or sections and useful sentences and phrases within verses.

### 3. Stories

If you have a relevant personal experience, make a note of it. It can also be helpful to recall stories you've read in literary works. Telling a short story or two is a good way to help the audience remain engaged with your talk

### 4. Jokes and Quips

If you have a *relevant* joke, adding a bit of humor to a talk is a good way to keep the interest of the audience or transition to a different subtopic.

## Organizing Material

Now that you have a good deal of material, it is helpful to organize it into a couple of subtopics. You don't necessarily need to draw hard category lines for your materials, but it's helpful to organize your material to give you an idea of what subtopics you'll be best prepared to speak about.

Once you have gathered the materials you think you'll need, let's [outline your talk](/prep-outline/).
