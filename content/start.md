Starting to write is the hardest part of writing a talk. So we'll break it into small pieces, and all you have to do is follow this guide.

This guide is intended for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who are asked to speak on Sundays. Materials specific to this church are mentioned here, but the principles in this guide can be adapted to help prepare any religious sermon.

This guide is not published or endorsed by any church, and is intended only as a helpful guide. If you desire to stray from this guide, please do. 

## What you'll need

- A way to record your thoughts (I prefer a notepad and pen)

- Access to scriptures, talks, quotes, and any other materials you may wish to reference

- A couple of hours (not necessarily all at once)

## First Step: A Topic

Have you been asked to speak about a particular topic?

[**No**, I need to choose a topic to speak about](/topic/)

[**Yes**, I have been assigned a topic to speak about](/style/)
