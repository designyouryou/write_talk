If you don't already know what to speak about, a critical first step is to choose a topic for your address. This step is perhaps the most important, as a well-established topic can guide your thoughts for the rest of your talk-writing process.

## Types of Topics

There are a wide range of options when it comes to choosing a topic. Consider the following options for some ideas:

- Ask a big question

- Focus on a word or word pattern

- Focus on a person or event in history

- Provide a commentary of an existing talk or talks

## Considerations

When selecting a topic, take the following into account:

- The setting for your talk (i.e. sacred occasion or lighthearted discussion)

- The length of your talk

- The interest level, age range, and demographic of your audience

- The topics that interest you

- How in-depth you wish to explore the topic

- The topics you are comfortable addressing publicly

- The topics you would be curious to learn more about

## Examples

The following are examples of topics which can be addressed in a wide variety of settings:

- How can I increase my faith?

- Daily repentance

- Noah's Ark

## Additional Inspiration

If you're stuck trying to come up with a topic, have a look through the [Gospel Topics](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/intro?lang=eng) page and see what strikes you as interesting.

## Your Turn

Select a topic for your talk. Make sure you write this somewhere you can refer to it throughout this process.
