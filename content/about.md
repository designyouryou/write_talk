I spend my days presenting academic works and lectures, and I love to prepare and deliver speeches, talks, and lectures. I've noticed many of my fellow church members lack a great deal of confidence when it comes to preparing and delivering a sermon, so I made this guide to help walk through the process of preparing and delivering a talk.

This was quite the labor of love, and it took a great deal of study and time. I don't profit from it, other than the satisfaction of having made something worthwhile. If you notice a problem with this service, or if you have a suggestion, I welcome that! Because of the places I've advertised this website, I would like to remain anonymous, but you can reach my anonymous profiles on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/chequecipote) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chequecipote). I'd love to collaborate if you have ideas!
