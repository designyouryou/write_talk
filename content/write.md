title: "Writing your Talk"
draft: false

At this point, you should have a substantial amount of your talk already written for you! All that remains until you have a complete talk is connecting your references to materials.

When writing my talk, I prefer to write it word-for-word. For people who don't speak on a regular basis, it is often unreasonable to rely on bullet points for a high-quality talk. If I have time to practice thoroughly, it can be helpful to reduce your word-for-word talk back to an outline to reference while you speak.

There seem to be some in the Church who feel that writing a talk word-for-word prevents them from allowing the Spirit to guide their talk. However, the Spirit can guide you just as well if you take time to carefully prepare your talk. And if you prepare your talk word-for-word, you can be much more confident that what you're saying is doctrinally correct.

I prefer the following workflow to efficiently draft my full text:

## 1. First Draft

At first, simply write a few thoughts about each piece of material in your outline. Come up with some transitions to insert between them. Don't focus on perfection; just get words onto the page.

It seems silly that this isn't a more involved process, but if you have good materials to draw from, your talk practically writes itself.

## 2. Proofreading

Then, read your talk out loud. Hearing the talk in your own voice will help guide your revisions. Mark anything that sounds awkward, and think of ways to re-phrase it.

When proofreading, think about your audience. Is your content all relevant to them? Have you written something that might offend them or distract from your message? Is your content on the right level for their understanding?

Also consider the duration of your talk. If you need to have a talk of flexible length, write the longest talk you may need to deliver. Then, mark paragraphs you can remove if you need to take less time.

I prefer to do 2 or 3 laps through my talks before compiling my final draft.

## 3. Final Talk

Finally, write your polished talk in a large text size with no annotations. I prefer to write my talks in the Georgia font at 14 points, but you should take care to adjust the font and size to make it as readable as possible.

I find it helpful to add headings to my talks, at least at every subtopic. I never read the headings, but they serve as landmarks for when I inevitably lose my place.

Make your talk available to yourself in a number of formats and locations. I personally upload my talk to cloud storage (i.e. Google Drive) so I can access it on my phone in a bind, and I print a copy. Remember, anything that can go wrong will, so if you have only one copy of a talk, be prepared to lose that copy.

Now you've written and proofread your talk, it's time to [practice](/practice/).
