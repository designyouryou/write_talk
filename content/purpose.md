Once you have both a topic and a style selected, you can combine them to form a specific purpose. When conceiving a specific purpose, there are a number of important considerations.

## Forming Your Purpose

Form a one-sentence purpose statement describing precisely what you intend to do in your talk. This is not the place for figurative language; your audience might not ever hear this purpose statement. Examples of effective purpose statements can include:

- Inform the audience about Paul's conversion

- Persuade the audience to volunteer their time and talents this week

- Encourage the audience to hope for a brighter future

## Considerations

It's important to establish a high-quality purpose statement. The following considerations will help you avoid wasted time as you plan your talk around your purpose statement.

### Consider the Duration

Ensure that you can accomplish your purpose in the time allotted. If you have only a few minutes to talk, a highly specific topic will allow you to achieve your purpose well. If you have a longer time to speak, consider a slightly broader topic with more specific subtopics.

### Consider Topical Relevance

Does your purpose statement fit the topic of your talk and of the meeting? For example, in a sacred meeting, you might not want to inform the audience in detail about medical procedures in the 1800s.

### Consider the Audience

Does the specific purpose statement cater to the needs of the audience? For example, a general audience might appreciate being persuaded to increase their faith more than they may appreciate an in-depth exploration of the word faith in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew.
