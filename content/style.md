When preparing any address, it is important to determine your presenting style early in the preparation process. This can help you guide decisions about your tone, the type of content you present, and the overall format of the talk. There are potentially infinite styles for talks, but we will focus here on only three. Most talks include elements of each style, but it is often best to limit the bulk of a talk to one style.

Each style has its own page of information, as well as some templates and example talks to help you write the type of talk you want.

## Educate

This is the style of choice when you want to present a bulk of interesting information. If your talk is going to be primarily theoretical, the lecture style is likely your best choice.

## Advocate

This is the style of choice when you want to change or open the audience's mind about something, or if you want to instigate action from the audience.

## Motivate

This is the style of choice when you want to inspire, encourage, or offer hope to an audience.
