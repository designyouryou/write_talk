Good morning, brothers and sisters.

(thank previous speakers/musical numbers)

When Moses was leading Israel through the wilderness, the Israelites forgot the Lord and started to complain about their circumstances. Because He loved them, the Lord sent serpents to their camp to help them remember Him and be humble. In this awful circumstance, the people repented and asked Moses to make the serpents go away. Instead, He gave the people a way to be healed if the serpents bit them.

The Lord told Moses to make a serpent out of brass and attach it to a post. If the people looked at the serpent, the Lord healed them. But because of the easiness of the way, many of the Israelites died from the serpents’ bites (1 Ne 17:41).

Just as the Lord called Moses to lead Israel thousands of years ago, He has called a prophet for our day. Just as poisonous serpents harmed the Israelites, we face the poisonous influence of the Adversary as we make our journey through life.

And often, the Lord gives us simple instructions through the prophet to help us heal. Several months ago, President Nelson gave a commandment to the church. He called us to **“*start today* to increase [our] faith.”** He promised, **“Through your faith, Jesus Christ will increase your ability to move the mountains in your life.”**

The past couple of years have been rough for everyone. It’s probably fair to say that recent events have taken a significant spiritual, emotional, and even physical toll on all of us. In many ways, our metaphorical mountains can seem to be growing around us. But just as the Lord offered the Israelites a way to recover from their injuries, He has offered us a way to move mountains and be healed in our lives.

President Nelson goes on,

> Your mountains may be loneliness, doubt, illness, or other personal problems. Your mountains will vary, and yet the answer to each of your challenges is to increase your faith. That takes work. Lazy learners and lax disciples will always struggle to muster even a particle of faith.

He then offers five suggestions to help us develop our faith. He invites us to **improve** our study habits, **choose** to believe in Jesus Christ, **act** in faith, worthily **partake** of sacred ordinances, and **ask** our Heavenly Father for help.

I would encourage you to read his whole talk; it is full of valuable insights. But I would like to focus today on his invitation to act in faith. He invites us to ponder:

> What would you do if you had *more* faith? Think about it. Write about it. Then *receive more* faith by doing something that *requires more* faith.

Increasing our faith requires acting on our faith. No matter the mountains in our lives, faith will help us move them. There is no sin or hardship beyond the infinite power of the Atonement, and all things are possible to them that believe.

Faith in Jesus Christ is a predecessor to all the other blessings in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. When we develop our faith and choose to trust the Savior, we are empowered to improve. Faith gives meaning and value to ordinances like the sacrament, baptism, and temple sealings. In an ever-more pessimistic world, faith gives us hope for a brighter future. I think Ether says it best:

> Whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.

(Eth 12:4)

When we develop our faith, we are better able to obey the commandments. If we want to have a strong foundation and stay firmly planted in the Gospel, surely increasing our faith is a necessary first step.

I am always awe-struck by powerful stories of faith from the scriptures. By faith, we understand the Creation of the World and our place in it (Heb 11:3). By faith, Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice (Heb 11:4), Enoch was translated (Heb 11:5), Noah survived the flood (Heb 11:7), Abraham and Sara had a child (Heb 11:11), and Moses led Israel out of captivity (Heb 11:27).

Through faith, people have “subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, [and] out of weakness were made strong” (Heb 11:33-34).

It can be tempting to think that all these things happened a long time ago, and that maybe we’re no longer eligible to experience these blessings. To that, I would echo the words of Mormon:

> Have miracles ceased because Christ hath ascended into heaven, and hath sat down on the right hand of God, to claim of the Father his rights of mercy which he hath upon the children of men? I say unto you, Nay; neither have angels ceased to minister unto the children of men.

(Mni 7:27-29)

Just as by faith, God enabled people throughout history to do incredible things, by faith we can do incredible things. I wonder: if Paul wrote Hebrews 11 in our day, what might he write?

It is possible he would write about saints who, through their faith, have stayed true to their covenants in spite of a global crisis. He may write about the sacrifices people make to repent of their sins and come unto Christ. Perhaps he would write about members who meet hostile situations with Christlike love and respect. He may even write about saints who courageously trust the prophet’s counsel to wear a mask and receive vaccines when they’re available despite not understanding the science behind them.

Nonetheless, it is interesting to me that in all of Paul’s examples, by faith, someone *does* something. Famously, James teaches:

> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?

(Jms 2:19-20)

James also teaches a principle that can motivate us to take a leap of faith. **“Seest thou how works wrought with his faith, and by works was faith made perfect?”** (Jms 2:22; JST). President Nelson similarly invited, “Then *receive more* faith by doing something that *requires more* faith”.

The Lord does not expect us to be perfect or have perfect faith all at once. Alma famously taught:

> if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.

(Alm 32:27)

Even if we feel our faith is weak, or even if we can only desire to believe, we are invited to act on our faith. Often, faith enables us to do the small and simple things that end up spiritually saving our lives. A few chapters after encouraging us to increase our faith, Alma reminds his son of Moses and the Israelites:

> do not let us be slothful because of the easiness of the way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would look they might live; even so it is with us. The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever.

(Alm 37:46)

By following the prophet’s counsel to develop our faith, we truly can overcome any challenge or obstacle in our lives. The Savior truly lives, and He loves us more than we can comprehend. He is eager to help us become like Him, and His infinite Atonement makes that possible. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
