Return to \u0026ldquo;Motivate\u0026rdquo; style\n Good morning, brothers and sisters.\n(thank previous speakers/musical numbers)\nWhen Moses was leading Israel through the wilderness, the Israelites forgot the Lord and started to complain about their circumstances. Because He loved them, the Lord sent serpents to their camp to help them remember Him and be humble. In this awful circumstance, the people repented and asked Moses to make the serpents go away. Instead, He gave the people a way to be healed if the serpents bit them.\nThe Lord told Moses to make a serpent out of brass and attach it to a post. If the people looked at the serpent, the Lord healed them. But because of the easiness of the way, many of the Israelites died from the serpents’ bites (1 Ne 17:41).\nJust as the Lord called Moses to lead Israel thousands of years ago, He has called a prophet for our day. Just as poisonous serpents harmed the Israelites, we face the poisonous influence of the Adversary as we make our journey through life.\nAnd often, the Lord gives us simple instructions through the prophet to help us heal. Several months ago, President Nelson gave a commandment to the church. He called us to “start today to increase [our] faith.” He promised, “Through your faith, Jesus Christ will increase your ability to move the mountains in your life.”\nThe past couple of years have been rough for everyone. It’s probably fair to say that recent events have taken a significant spiritual, emotional, and even physical toll on all of us. In many ways, our metaphorical mountains can seem to be growing around us. But just as the Lord offered the Israelites a way to recover from their injuries, He has offered us a way to move mountains and be healed in our lives.\nPresident Nelson goes on,\n Your mountains may be loneliness, doubt, illness, or other personal problems. Your mountains will vary, and yet the answer to each of your challenges is to increase your faith. That takes work. Lazy learners and lax disciples will always struggle to muster even a particle of faith.\n He then offers five suggestions to help us develop our faith. He invites us to improve our study habits, choose to believe in Jesus Christ, act in faith, worthily partake of sacred ordinances, and ask our Heavenly Father for help.\nI would encourage you to read his whole talk; it is full of valuable insights. But I would like to focus today on his invitation to act in faith. He invites us to ponder:\n What would you do if you had more faith? Think about it. Write about it. Then receive more faith by doing something that requires more faith.\n Increasing our faith requires acting on our faith. No matter the mountains in our lives, faith will help us move them. There is no sin or hardship beyond the infinite power of the Atonement, and all things are possible to them that believe.\nFaith in Jesus Christ is a predecessor to all the other blessings in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. When we develop our faith and choose to trust the Savior, we are empowered to improve. Faith gives meaning and value to ordinances like the sacrament, baptism, and temple sealings. In an ever-more pessimistic world, faith gives us hope for a brighter future. I think Ether says it best:\n Whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.\n (Eth 12:4)\nWhen we develop our faith, we are better able to obey the commandments. If we want to have a strong foundation and stay firmly planted in the Gospel, surely increasing our faith is a necessary first step.\nI am always awe-struck by powerful stories of faith from the scriptures. By faith, we understand the Creation of the World and our place in it (Heb 11:3). By faith, Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice (Heb 11:4), Enoch was translated (Heb 11:5), Noah survived the flood (Heb 11:7), Abraham and Sara had a child (Heb 11:11), and Moses led Israel out of captivity (Heb 11:27).\nThrough faith, people have “subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, [and] out of weakness were made strong” (Heb 11:33-34).\nIt can be tempting to think that all these things happened a long time ago, and that maybe we’re no longer eligible to experience these blessings. To that, I would echo the words of Mormon:\n Have miracles ceased because Christ hath ascended into heaven, and hath sat down on the right hand of God, to claim of the Father his rights of mercy which he hath upon the children of men? I say unto you, Nay; neither have angels ceased to minister unto the children of men.\n (Mni 7:27-29)\nJust as by faith, God enabled people throughout history to do incredible things, by faith we can do incredible things. I wonder: if Paul wrote Hebrews 11 in our day, what might he write?\nIt is possible he would write about saints who, through their faith, have stayed true to their covenants in spite of a global crisis. He may write about the sacrifices people make to repent of their sins and come unto Christ. Perhaps he would write about members who meet hostile situations with Christlike love and respect. He may even write about saints who courageously trust the prophet’s counsel to wear a mask and receive vaccines when they’re available despite not understanding the science behind them.\nNonetheless, it is interesting to me that in all of Paul’s examples, by faith, someone does something. Famously, James teaches:\n Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?\n (Jms 2:19-20)\nJames also teaches a principle that can motivate us to take a leap of faith. “Seest thou how works wrought with his faith, and by works was faith made perfect?” (Jms 2:22; JST). President Nelson similarly invited, “Then receive more faith by doing something that requires more faith”.\nThe Lord does not expect us to be perfect or have perfect faith all at once. Alma famously taught:\n if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.\n (Alm 32:27)\nEven if we feel our faith is weak, or even if we can only desire to believe, we are invited to act on our faith. Often, faith enables us to do the small and simple things that end up spiritually saving our lives. A few chapters after encouraging us to increase our faith, Alma reminds his son of Moses and the Israelites:\n do not let us be slothful because of the easiness of the way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would look they might live; even so it is with us. The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever.\n (Alm 37:46)\nBy following the prophet’s counsel to develop our faith, we truly can overcome any challenge or obstacle in our lives. The Savior truly lives, and He loves us more than we can comprehend. He is eager to help us become like Him, and His infinite Atonement makes that possible. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.\nReferences Russell M.

When you quote scriptures and respected figures, an audience assigns more value to what you say. Gathering and using high-quality materials is a great way to build credibility with an audience. Even prominent church leaders often cite scriptures, philosophers, literary works, and other church leaders.\nThis phase is dedicated to gathering and organizing a large bulk of good information, not to deciding where to put it in a talk. Your goal at this point is quantity, not necessarily quality. Try for about 2-3 resources per minute you\u0026rsquo;ll speak.

I personally prefer the following workflow to quickly compile a great deal of good information.\n1. Scriptures Using the following resources, find scriptures relevant to your topic. Finding a variety of scriptures by a number of different authors helps add variety to your message. When finding scriptures, look both for whole verses or sections and useful sentences and phrases within verses.\n  Topical Guide\n  Bible Dictionary\n  Guide to the Scriptures\n  Gospel Topics Reference\n  Reference Guide to the Bible and Book of Mormon\n  Bible translations at Bible Hub\n  2.

At this point, all that\u0026rsquo;s left to do is practice your talk. Practice first by reading every word of your talk out loud. Eventually work on looking more at your audience than at your notes.\nOn Eye Contact If making eye contact with an audience is troubling for you, here are a few tricks I find helpful:\n  Tell someone you trust to sit in the middle of the audience, toward the back. Let this person know you\u0026rsquo;ll be trying to make eye contact with them. Then, when you look at your audience, look at this person. The audience won\u0026rsquo;t be any the wiser, since you\u0026rsquo;ll move your eyes past them every time you look up.\n  Before you speak, find a point of interest halfway up the back wall and each side wall. It could be an irregularity in the wall covering, a clock, a piece of molding, or even a person. When you look up, visually locate two points of interest. For example, slowly pan your view from the wall clock to the toddler in the back row.\n  If eye contact is quite difficult for you, don\u0026rsquo;t sweat it. Chances are, most of the audience will not look at you anyway. It is more valuable to deliver a high-quality address while looking at your notes than it is to deliver a distracted address while trying to look up.\n  On Practicing Out Loud Practicing your talk out loud is crucial. You don\u0026rsquo;t really know what words will trip you up until you\u0026rsquo;ve tried to say them. When delivering your talk, remember to speak deliberately and clearly so you can be understood. I find it helpful to imagine I\u0026rsquo;m delivering my talk to an audience whose first language is not English. That forces me to slow my delivery down and speak clearly.\nWhen practicing your talk, deliberately add moments of silence. These moments will help your mind catch up with your mouth, and they give you a natural way to prevent getting lost in your notes. I add a red star in my notes after impactful points to remember to pause. It will feel strange at first, but it conveys an amount of confidence few novice speakers manage to achieve. Consider the difference:\n God loves you more than words can express. Um\u0026hellip;. The scriptures teach that \u0026ldquo;For God so loved the world\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nGod loves you more than words can express. [2-second pause] The scriptures teach that \u0026ldquo;For God so loved the world\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n On Timing If you have a specific time limit, practice (and edit) until you can precisely meet that time limit.\nIf you have a range of times you may need to fill (i.e. if you are the final speaker), plan a separate talk for each time limit. I highlight the margin of paragraphs to cut, depending on my time restrictions. If my range is 5-20 minutes, for example, I mark paragraphs to cut for a 15-minute talk in red, paragraphs to cut for a 10-minute talk in yellow, and paragraphs to cut for a 5-minute talk in green. I then decide, just before I begin my address, which talk length to deliver.\nFor either method, practice out loud, including pauses, until you can deliver your talk in the right amount of time. It can be quite valuable to record yourself speaking and review the recording, if you have the time and resources to do so.\nCongratulations! You\u0026rsquo;ve written and practiced a talk.

My preferred workflow is below, and I have also provided outline templates.\n1. Choose Subtopics Choose, as a general rule, one subtopic for about every 5 minutes you\u0026rsquo;ll speak for a short talk or every 10 minutes for a long talk. Your subtopics should be relevant to your topic and align with your specific purpose and style. For example, if your purpose is to inform people about ways they can increase their faith, your outline may start as follows:\n Ways to increase faith  Increase faith by study and prayer Increase faith through good works Increase faith with a desire to believe     2. Add Materials to Subtopics Since you\u0026rsquo;ve already sorted materials into some subtopics, now is a good time to arrange them into your subtopics. Try to create a logical flow between materials, perhaps imagining how you intend to move from one reference to another.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll probably want to use about one resource per minute, as a general rule. This can give you enough time to make poignant remarks about a resource, but not so much time you have to make up nonsense to have enough to say.\n 3. Prepare an Introduction An introduction should put the audience at ease while creating interest. Consider talks you have listened to. In the first few seconds, the audience already makes a decision on whether or not they care about your talk.\nA good introduction:\n  Shows you\u0026rsquo;re prepared and (at least pretending to be) confident\n  Focuses on the message and not its delivery\n  Tells the audience immediately what you intend to address\n  Establishes credibility and goodwill\n  A less effective introduction:\n  Indicates a lack of preparedness to the audience\n  Focuses more on the speaker than the message\n  Fails to get the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention\n  Tells the story of being asked to speak\n  Complains or comments about having to speak\n  Introduction Styles Especially for speakers less familiar with presenting material to an audience, the introduction can be the hardest part of a talk to get right. Thankfully, there are a handful of tried-and-true techniques to starting a talk that can get your talk to a great start. It is important to keep an introduction relatively short, as too much introduction will quickly bore an audience.\nThink of an introduction to a talk just like the introduction to a hymn. The audience needs enough of a heads-up to get their attention and know where things are headed. But if an introduction lasts too long, they will start to think they\u0026rsquo;re listening to a musical number, and they can stop paying attention.\nHelpful Tip: It can be tempting to begin with a joke, but at the start of your talk, the audience is tense and not used to your speaking style. It is best to wait until your subtopics or conclusion to tell a joke. At that point, the audience will be familiar enough with you to enjoy the joke.\nConsider using or adapting one of the following styles for your talk:\nAcademic Introduction. This is the most straightforward way to begin. It is precise, no-nonsense, and alerts your audience of your intentions immediately. It goes something like this:\n Good morning, brothers and sisters. I intend today to answer the question \u0026ldquo;[some version of your purpose statement] using 3 main points. [summary of your subtopics].\n At first, it seems dry and clunky. But it indicates to the audience a high level of preparedness and confidence. It puts the audience at ease by subtly indicating there will be no surprises in your talk. And it focuses entirely on the message you intend to share.\nTell a Story. People love stories, so it can be interesting to the audience to begin your talk with a story. When you use this introduction style, there\u0026rsquo;s no need for niceties \u0026ndash; just jump right in. This type of introduction might go something like this:\n Brothers and sisters, several years ago while I was speaking in general conference, the sight in my left eye was suddenly compromised by something called macular degeneration, which subsequently worsened and has left me without useful vision in that eye.\n\u0026ldquo;Missionary Service Blessed My Life Forever\u0026rdquo; by M. Russell Ballard.\n This style is effective and popular because it gets people\u0026rsquo;s attention quickly and helps slowly guide their thoughts toward your topic. If used correctly, it arouses curiosity in the audience. And stories are easy to make appealing to a broad audience.\nRelate to the Audience. This adaptation of an anecdotal introduction sparks the imagination of your audience. Since people pay attention to things which directly affect them, relating a topic to them directly encourages them to pay attention to what you say for the rest of your talk. It might go something like this:\n It\u0026rsquo;s Sunday afternoon, and you\u0026rsquo;re with your siblings in your grandparents\u0026rsquo; living room. They talk and laugh with you for hours about the crazy things that you all did as kids.\n This is an especially powerful introduction style if your purpose is to persuade the audience. The above example is a great way to relay the importance of doing family history work or building good family relationships.\nArouse Curiosity. This introduction style goes as long as it can without telling the audience what you\u0026rsquo;ll talk about. Instead, it presents interesting details so the audience mentally has to guess what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about until you finally reveal it. It goes something like this:\n Everyone in this room has a key to happiness. It is this same key to happiness that makes us true disciples of Christ. It invokes a promise from the Lord that He will be with us. Indeed, it allows us to fulfil our divine purpose on this earth. Many overlook this key to happiness, and others still think it is outside their reach. It\u0026rsquo;s not about money, power, or intelligence. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about dedicating ourselves to loving and serving others.\n This approach builds some suspense, and is is a highly effective way to introduce some of your subtopics while you whet the audience\u0026rsquo;s curiosity about your topic.\nUse a Quote. A relevant quote can be a good way to get the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention and foreshadow a central theme in your talk. An interesting scripture is often a highly effective introduction, as many scriptures can lead to a number of conclusions, leaving your audience curious about the intent of your talk. It can go something like this:\n When the Lord called six elders, He instructed: \u0026ldquo;Ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts.\u0026rdquo; When we work to understand the Gospel, we ought to soften our hearts to the counsel of the Lord.\n Preview your Talk After you get the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention, walk them through your subtopics. You might simply say, \u0026ldquo;I will address 3 points: a, b, and c\u0026rdquo;. But it can be more interesting and easier to follow if you use a simple sentence, which you can repeat as a transition into each of your subtopics. It works something like this:\n Becoming more self-reliant can help us improve our personal finances, make us better able to serve others, and even improve our mental health.\nBecoming more self-reliant can help us improve our personal finances. [tell more about this for a couple of minutes]\nBecoming more self-reliant can make us better able to serve others. [tell more about this for a couple of minutes]\nBecoming more self-reliant can even improve our mental health. [tell more about this for a couple of minutes]\n  4. Prepare a Conclusion When you are ready to end your talk, it\u0026rsquo;s important to wrap up cleanly. In many church meetings, testifying of the truth of your message is an implicit signal to the audience that you\u0026rsquo;re finishing your message. It can often be powerful, though, to testify briefly of the truth of what you\u0026rsquo;re sharing throughout your talk and conclude in another way.\nWhen you conclude, begin by briefly summarizing your subtopics. Then, there are a few options for a potent end to your talk. It is best to keep a conclusion brief.\nCall to Action. If your goal is to motivate the audience to act, a call to action can be an excellent way to end a talk. Calls to action are often well-accompanied by scripturally-founded promises of blessings. It goes something like this:\n I plead with you to accept the Savior’s invitation. Like a meek and loving child, accept His help. Make and keep the covenants He offers in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They will strengthen you. The Savior knows the storms and the places of safety on the way home to Him and to our Heavenly Father. He knows the way. He is the Way. I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\n\u0026ldquo;Steady in the Storms\u0026rdquo;, By President Henry B. Eyring\n Use a Quote. Like in an introduction, a quote can be a pleasing way to end a talk. It can go something like this:\n “It is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine. But it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low.” This is the Church of Jesus Christ. His gospel blesses families here on earth and throughout the eternities. It guides us in our lives as we strive to become eternal families. I know this is true. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\n\u0026ldquo;Teaching Self-Reliance to Children and Youth\u0026rdquo;, By Elder Hugo E. Martinez\n Make a Dramatic Statement. It can occasionally be helpful to devise your own dramatic statement to end your talk. This is often better-suited for secular talks than religious devotionals, but it can be helpful nonetheless. Consider Patrick Henry\u0026rsquo;s legendary \u0026ldquo;Liberty or Death\u0026rdquo; speech:\n I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death.\n Use a Mixed Approach. It can also be helpful to combine concluding methods, such as in this example:\n So, my dear friends and beloved fellow disciples of Jesus Christ, let us not be “weary in well-doing, for [we] are laying the foundation of a great work.” And out of our small things will proceed “that which is great.” I testify that this is true, as I also testify that Jesus Christ is our Master, our Redeemer, and our one and only Way back to our beloved Father in Heaven. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\n\u0026ldquo;Our Heartfelt All\u0026rdquo;, By Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf\n  Now that your content is thoroughly outlined, it\u0026rsquo;s finally time to write your content.\n","permalink":"/prep-outline/","summary":"Now that you have a good idea what you\u0026rsquo;re speaking about and what materials you\u0026rsquo;ll draw from, it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to form an outline for your talk. My preferred workflow is below, and I have also provided outline templates.\n1. Choose Subtopics Choose, as a general rule, one subtopic for about every 5 minutes you\u0026rsquo;ll speak for a short talk or every 10 minutes for a long talk. Your subtopics should be relevant to your topic and align with your specific purpose and style.","title":"Preparing a Talk Outline"},{"content":"At this point, you should have a substantial amount of your talk already written for you! All that remains until you have a complete talk is connecting your references to materials.\nWhen writing my talk, I prefer to write it word-for-word. For people who don\u0026rsquo;t speak on a regular basis, it is often unreasonable to rely on bullet points for a high-quality talk. If I have time to practice thoroughly, it can be helpful to reduce your word-for-word talk back to an outline to reference while you speak.\nThere seem to be some in the Church who feel that writing a talk word-for-word prevents them from allowing the Spirit to guide their talk. However, the Spirit can guide you just as well if you take time to carefully prepare your talk. And if you prepare your talk word-for-word, you can be much more confident that what you\u0026rsquo;re saying is doctrinally correct.\nI prefer the following workflow to efficiently draft my full text:\n1. First Draft At first, simply write a few thoughts about each piece of material in your outline. Come up with some transitions to insert between them. Don\u0026rsquo;t focus on perfection; just get words onto the page.\nIt seems silly that this isn\u0026rsquo;t a more involved process, but if you have good materials to draw from, your talk practically writes itself.\n2. Proofreading Then, read your talk out loud. Hearing the talk in your own voice will help guide your revisions. Mark anything that sounds awkward, and think of ways to re-phrase it.\nWhen proofreading, think about your audience. Is your content all relevant to them? Have you written something that might offend them or distract from your message? Is your content on the right level for their understanding?\nAlso consider the duration of your talk. If you need to have a talk of flexible length, write the longest talk you may need to deliver. Then, mark paragraphs you can remove if you need to take less time.\nI prefer to do 2 or 3 laps through my talks before compiling my final draft.\n3. Final Talk Finally, write your polished talk in a large text size with no annotations. I prefer to write my talks in the Georgia font at 14 points, but you should take care to adjust the font and size to make it as readable as possible.\nI find it helpful to add headings to my talks, at least at every subtopic. I never read the headings, but they serve as landmarks for when I inevitably lose my place.\nMake your talk available to yourself in a number of formats and locations. I personally upload my talk to cloud storage (i.e. Google Drive) so I can access it on my phone in a bind, and I print a copy. Remember, anything that can go wrong will, so if you have only one copy of a talk, be prepared to lose that copy.\n Now you\u0026rsquo;ve written and proofread your talk, it\u0026rsquo;s time to practice.\n","permalink":"/write/","summary":"At this point, you should have a substantial amount of your talk already written for you!
